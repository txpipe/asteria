# Gameplay

## Building a ship

- to create a ship, the participant has to mint a new `ShipToken` and matching `PilotToken` through a mint validator called `ShipyardPolicy`.
- each Pilot / Ship token pair will be unique. The validator will ensure uniqueness by incrementing a "counter" datum locked in the `AsteriaUtxo`.
- the asset name of the `ShipToken` and `PilotToken` will contain the counter value as a suffix. Eg: `SHIP23` and `PILOT23`.
- the `ShipToken` needs to be locked in the `SpaceTimeScript` and the `PilotToken` needs to go to an address controlled by the participant.
- the mint process will require locking an ADA payment adding to the reward pot. The amount of this payment is defined by our constant `SHIP_MINT_FEE`.

## Moving your ship

- movement of a ship through the grid is achieved by a transaction the consumes the `ShipState` UTxO and outputs a new one with the updated state.
- the maximum _distance_ that can be achieved in a single transaction is constrained by the constant `MAX_SHIP_MOVEMENT_PER_TX`.
- moving the ship will consume a quantity of fuel proportional to the distance. The ratio of fuel required per distance unit is defined by the constant `FUEL_PER_DISTANCE_UNIT`.

## Gathering fuel

- gathering fuel is achieved by a transaction that consumes the `ShipUtxo` and a `PelletUtxo` and outputs a new `ShipUtxo` with increased fuel value.
- to consume a fuel pellet, the position of the ship must overlap with the position of the pellet.
- the total amount of fuel that ship has can't exceed the `MAX_SHIP_FUEL` parameter.
- if the fuel pellet isn't totally consumed, a new `PelletUtxo` needs to be generated with the remaining of the fuel and maintaining the same location in the grid.

## Mining Asteria

- this action is achieved by a transaction that consumes the `ShipUtxo` and `AsteriaUtxo` and outputs a new one that extracts assets from the `AsteriaUtxo` into a wallet defined by the participant.
- the amount of assets that can be extracted from the `AsteriaUtxo` must not exceed a percentage of the total available defined by the `MAX_ASTERIA_MINING`.
- to execute this action, the `ShipUtxo` must be present at coordinates `(0, 0)`.
