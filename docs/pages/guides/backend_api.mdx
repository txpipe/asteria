# Querying the Backend API

Project Asteria provides a `GraphQL` API to query the state of the game. The primary query used is `objectsInRadius`, which retrieves objects within a specified radius around a given point.

## Example Query

Below is an example of a query to get objects around the center point (0,0) with a radius of 10:

```graphql
query getObjects {
  objectsInRadius(center: { x: 0, y: 0 }, radius: 10) {
    ... on Ship {
      __typename
      id
      position {
        x
        y
      }
    }
    
    ... on Fuel {
      __typename
      id
      position {
        x
        y
      }
    }
    
    ... on Asteria {
      __typename
      id
      position {
        x
        y
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Example Response

          "x": 1,
          "y": 3

          "x": 7,
          "y": -1
        }
      },
      {
        "__typename": "Fuel",
        "id": "761740a434acd2601cb363d5be6b979dd7fb270a6ba6d5f2a4f719e15bec693a#0",

          "y": -8
        }

        "__typename": "Asteria",
        "id": "fc6bec839c05a4ec687c42057818c0cb9b8fbd827b6779e2c06c63487439f95a#1",
        "position": {
          "x": 0,
          "y": 0
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

A preview testnet `GraphQL` endpoint is available at [https://dmtr_scrolls_v0_preview_1t9nhgnmxtpzrzm2gwv0723cu.scrolls-m0.demeter.run/graphql](https://dmtr_scrolls_v0_preview_1t9nhgnmxtpzrzm2gwv0723cu.scrolls-m0.demeter.run/graphql).

## Implementation Details

The backend uses a SQL query with a Manhattan distance calculation to find objects within the specified radius. The query ensures that the objects are within the bounds defined by the radius and the center point.

```rs
let fetched_objects = sqlx::query_as!(MapObjectRecord,
    "SELECT id, fuel, positionX as position_x, positionY as position_y, shipyardPolicy as policy_id, shipTokenName as token_name, pilotTokenName as pilot_name, class, totalRewards as total_rewards
     FROM mapobjects
     WHERE positionX BETWEEN ($1::int - $3::int) AND ($1::int + $3::int)
     AND positionY BETWEEN ($2::int - $3::int) AND ($2::int + $3::int)
     AND ABS(positionX - $1::int) + ABS(positionY - $2::int) <= $3::int
     AND shipyardPolicy = $4::text",
    center.x, center.y, radius, shipyard_policy_id.id.to_string()
)
```

## Database and Projection

The database consists of UTXOs in the smart contract validators. These UTXOs are projected into a materialized view using [Mumak](https://github.com/txpipe/mumak), a PostgreSQL extension that allows developers to project or filter CBOR data within PostgreSQL. The generated materialized view is queried by the backend API as if it were a regular table. This enables efficient distance queries over CBOR data directly within PostgreSQL.
