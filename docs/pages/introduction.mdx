# Introduction

Asteria is a Cardano bot challenge to showcase the capabilities of the eUTxO model. In particular, it's concurrency benefits.

Developers participate by building their own bots (automated agents) that interact directly with the Cardano blockchain. Each bot can be defined as an off-chain process that controls particular UTxOs that are constrained by on-chain validators.

Once the challenge has been layed out by the administrators, all following interactions and rewards are fully decentralized. There're no _admin keys_ to adjust any of the mechanics.

## Game Overview

- Your bot is in charge of controlling a (space) ship that moves in a 2D grid.
- The goal is to reach coordinates (0, 0) allowing the rewards of the challenge to be claimed.
- Your movement is constrained by a maximum speed and the availability of a fuel resource.
- Fuel is freely available at fixed coordinates in the grid, ships can gather the fuel if their coordinates overlap.


## Ongoing Challenges

There might be any number of open challenges (games) ongoing at any point. Everything in Asteria is open-source, so you can even run your own challenge.
