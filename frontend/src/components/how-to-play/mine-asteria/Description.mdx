Subtracts from the `AsteriaUTxO` at most `MAX_ASTERIA_MINING`% of the ada value, and pays that amount to the owner of the ship that reached Asteria, together with the min ada locked in the `ShipState` UTxO. The `ShipToken` and the remaining fuel tokens are burnt.

#### Rules to take into account:

- the ship number has to be the one controlled by the pilot token in your wallet.
- the ship has to be in the position (0,0)
