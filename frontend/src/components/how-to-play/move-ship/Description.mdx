#### With this transaction you can move the ship through the space.

This transaction updates the `pos_x`, `pos_y` and `fuel` datum fields of the `ShipState` UTxO by adding the `delta_x` and `delta_y` values specified in the redeemer, and subtracts from the ship value the amount of fuel tokens needed for the displacement (which are burnt in this tx). Also updates the `last_move_latest_time` field with the transaction's validity range latest posix time.

#### Rules to take into account:

- the ship number has to be the one controlled by the pilot token in your wallet.
- the total distance you travel is constrained by the number of slots between your tx validity range (ttl end - ttl start).
- the amount of fuel you pass is proportional to the total distance you travel (deltaX + deltaY).
