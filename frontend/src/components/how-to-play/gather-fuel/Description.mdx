#### With this transaction you can gather fuel from the fuel pellets for your ship.

Updates the amount of fuel tokens in both `ShipState` and `PelletState` UTxOs, adding the `amount` (specified in the redeemer) from the first and subtracting it from the latter. Also allows the ship owner to get any amount of the prize tokens held in the pellet.

#### Rules to take into account:

- the ship number has to be the one controlled by the pilot token in your wallet.
- the ship has to be in the same position than the pellet
- the ship can't have more than 5 fuel units
